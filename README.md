# AS607_Final_Project_Database_Code_MZ
This Python and R code was created to interact with a PostgreSQL database final project for the AS430.607 Spatial Database and Data Interoperability elective course for the Masters of Science in Geographic Information Systems at Johns Hopkins University.

The **act_hist_data_processing.py** file processes an active and historical forest fire dataset found in a PostgreSQL database.

The **fc_into_pg.py** file converts any shapefile (.shp) or feature class found within a file geodatabase (.gdb) into a PostgreSQL spatially-enabled dataset.

The **htspt_by_fr_cntr.py** file conducts a hotspot analysis from an active and historical forest fire dataset found in a PostgreSQL database.

The **poly_regression.R** file conducts a polynomial regression between time vs frequency and time vs severity for forest fires from an active and historical forest fire dataset found in a PostgreSQL database.

The **recreate_table.py** file creates or recreates a spatially-enabled dataset found within a PostgreSQL database.
